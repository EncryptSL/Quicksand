#Quicksand
A TNTRUN-inspired minigame for Bukkit and Spigot servers

## About
Quicksand is a minigame in which players run across the surface of the arena while the blocks they step on disappear. When they fall down into a layer of water, their game is over. The last player alive is the winner!
Quicksand is simple to use: simply build an arena with any block as the surface, followed immediately underneath with a block of TNT. Simply set the arena spawnpoints and configure the minimum amount of players, and begin playing in a matter of seconds! Quicksand is fun, competitive, and is a must-have for every minigame server.
