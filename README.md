# Quicksand
A TNTRUN-inspired minigame for Bukkit and Spigot servers, serving Minecraft 1.9 and above.

## About
Run across a layer of sand and TNT without falling through to the bottom! With each step you take, the blocks below you disappear into the unknown. Your goal is to be the last player still on the ground. Quicksand is fun, competitive, and is a must-have for every minigame server.
